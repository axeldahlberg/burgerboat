Forget the food truck â€“ here comes the food boat! Apparently the burger craze shows no signs of slowing down in Stockholm, but being creative sets you apart and the boys at Burger Boat will be taking advantage of our water-friendly city this summer, sailing between piers on a boat they built themselves. Pierre Doverbratt, Jonatan Lindberg and Elias Uusitalo came up with the idea while traveling around the US, where they spent a great deal of time sailing and eating burgers. Thus, the idea of the Burger Boat was born, raising the bar for the next burger baron. 100 percent organic Swedish beef made on a boat featuring solar panels. This is Stockholm of today, people.
